# Nashville Software School Full Stack Capstone: "DigiPax"

### Specs and Technologies Used:

I created a full stack ASP.NET Core application that utilizes MVC design pattern and the following packages and languages:

1. [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/): ORM
2. [Identity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/identity/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-aspnet-identity): User Authentication
3. [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/): Core application functionality
4. [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/): Used to dynamically populate drop drown fields in the pack creation form
5. [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/): Core application styling
6. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): Cool Icons
7. [X.PagedList.Mvc.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/X.PagedList.Mvc.Core/): Pagination

### Final Result:

**"DigiPax" is a platform for beat-makers and music producers to distribute and download ROYALTY FREE audio samples from a pool of samples uploaded exclusively from the user-base. DigiPax operates as a free, pay-it-forward service, where users are encouraged to upload context and are given access to audition samples in the browser, and download samples of their choosing.**

> Upon account registration, users are directed to the landing page and given access to the entirety of the application.

> Users may navigate to "Samples" where they can upload content to the sample pool.

> Users may also explore the sample pool for content they like by filtering by  sample name, or by sorting any of the pool columns in ascending or descending order.

> Users may favorite samples they like. These favorited samples will be indicated with an icon in the sample pool, and will also generate in a favorites list in "Collections".

> Users may keep track of their specifically uploaded content, and choose how to manage it (Delete it from the pool). User uploaded samples are generated within a list in "Collections".

> Users may add gear to their Gear List and keep track of their collections with details and images. Users may also add gear to their Wish List and keep track of it similarly to their gear list.

> Users may create packs of samples by combining up to 16 samples in a single pack. All users can see all packs, as they are all public in this version of the application. In a future version, users will be able to create private packs, and download a pack of samples as a single download.

#### Note From The Contributor:
Thank you for exploring my application! This is the first full stack MVC application I've ever built. I look forward to the continuation of the project and am planning future versions with a few things in mind:

> A smoother user experience

> Implementation of new features such as downloading a pack (multiple files compressed into a folder and downloaded)
